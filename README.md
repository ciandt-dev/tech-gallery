A skeleton application for Google Cloud Endpoints in Java.

## Products
- [App Engine][1]

## Language
- [Java][2]

## APIs
- [Google Cloud Endpoints][3]
- [Google App Engine Maven plugin][4]

## Setup Instructions

1. Update the value of `application` in `appengine-web.xml` to the app
   ID you have registered in the App Engine admin console and would
   like to use to host your instance of this sample.

1. Optional step: These sub steps are not required but you need this
   if you want to have auth protected methods.

    1. Update the values:
        1. `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_CLIENT_ID` | (From a Service Acc on GCP)
        1. `WEB_CLIENT_ID` | (Create an OAuth acc on GCP to get credentials)

        in `src/main/java/${packageInPathFormat}/Constants.java`
       to reflect the respective client IDs you have registered in the
       [APIs Console][6]. 

    1. Update the values:
        1. `CLIENT_ID` | same used in `WEB_CLIENT_ID`

        in `src/main/webapp/modules/auth/index.js` to reflect the respective client IDs you have registered in the
        [APIs Console][6].

    1. You also need to supply the web client ID you have registered
       in the [APIs Console][4] to your client of choice (web, Android,
       iOS).

1. Run the application with `mvn appengine:run`, and ensure it's
   running by visiting your local server's api explorer's address (by
   default [localhost:8080/_ah/api/explorer][5].)

1. Deploy your application to Google App Engine with

   $ mvn appengine:deploy
